Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

If you get up and walk away
Leave the past behind
Go ahead and take a ride
No telling what you'll find
The words you say don't mean a thing
They fly right by my eyes
Look in the mirror, don't look at me
Maybe then you'll realize

Oh, oh

So get up and go
If you're so tired of moving slow, go
If you're so tired of moving slow, go
Get up and go

I was on the inside
Just looking out for you
But you're the one to make a change
There's nothing I can do
Now's the time for you to move
Actions shout out loud
So cut the talk and move your feet
'Cause words get lost in crowds

Quit talking, start walking now
Quit talking, start walking now

So get up and go
If you're so tired of moving slow, go
If you're so tired of moving slow, go
Get up and go

Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

Go, get up and go
Go, get up and go
Go, get up and go
Go, get up and go

So get up and go
If you're so tired of moving slow, go
If you're so tired of moving slow, go

If you're so tired of moving slow, go
If you're so tired of moving slow, go
Get up and go, oh
Go!
