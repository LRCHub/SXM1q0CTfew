Get up!
Don't again back on your feet!
To get up
Don't let nobody break you down!

Oh don't get the passion, control of your mind
Oh don't get frustration, announce of your time
And feel ebony, ...
Your hopes to the crown
And baby don't stop your cry!
And baby one more try!

Oh if you want it, you got it!
You scour each feeling
You can dream it, believe it
It's got to be really
And feel ebony, ...
Your hopes to the crown
And baby don't stop your cry!
And baby one more try!

Yeah, yeah, yeah... Ouhouh...

Get up!
